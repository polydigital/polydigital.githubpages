## Social Good
We address problems within our society, communities and environment. We deliver alternative solutions for a fairer, safer and sustainable future.

## Cooperation over Collaboration over Conflict
Our view is that cooperation is better than the need to collaborate on everything and that collaboration is better than conflict.  Our actions are often independent and are made with our shared values working towards shared goals. Acceptance of this in our decisions means our cooperation with each other. Cooperation is better than a blanket policy for collaboration on everything we do which would become a bottleneck hindering our productivity and becoming costly.  We will know when our decisions need collaboration based on our other values such as fairness and integrity.  We embrace challenge and alternative opinions can often be received as conflict though our view is that this is collaborating, we leave our egos out of the discussion an arrive at better decisions and solutions. Conflict is not an option.

## Simplicity and Transparency
If we can’t communicate it easily it’s probably too complex.  We break down complexity and strive for simplicity so we can maintain and support our own goals, strategies and code.  A solution should be as simple as possible and no simpler.  We bring a transparency to all we do demonstrating our openness and other values as well as testing if our work is becoming too complicated.

## Sustainability
For us sustainability means living within ecological, social and personal limits such that we try to offset the resources we use with benefits as well as protect and care for those resources so we can regenerate them - this includes the environment, our communities, our organisation and ourselves.

## Make everything open
As far as is possible, bearing in mind our commitment to fairness, integrity and sustainability, our products and practices should be open. We take the view that secrecy - secret code, secret methods and secret business practices - does not add value, but instead erodes trust. A culture of openness fosters mass participation in our aims.

## Integrity, honesty, fairness and respect for everyone
We work together because we share the same values and want to effect change in the world. We acknowledge that when organisations interact with individuals, there is frequently a disparity of power in the organisation’s favour, and we pledge to exercise that power ethically.  We bring integrity into everything we do, whether we are working on a problem together, liaising with our stakeholders or just generally communicating to broader communities.  We call out three specific attributes which we feel strongly about.

* **Truth to power embodied in honesty** - we don’t play games with each other, we hope there are no surprises and we are open about who we are and what we stand for.  
* **Fairness** - we believe that we all need a voice and should be listened to as an equal - our skills and personal attributes are determined by market factors they are based on face value of delivering into the work we do.  
* **Respect** - we always give each other the time and space to think and speak, there are never wrong views or silly questions only ones which lead to better and broader understandings and we recognise our differences as being one of our main strengths.

## Review values on a regular basis
These values will be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain practical and comprehensive. We will also regularly assess our practices to ensure that they are in line with our values. We strive for continuous improvements of ourselves and our work.  We review our own values, ways of working, skills and personal traits and look for opportunities for feedback as much as possible so we can address any suggestions we feel will make a better culture and us better people.  Our work is constantly under stress and test so we can assess from as many sources as possible how we make our services and products better for our users. Anyone, inside or outside of the organisation, should feel empowered to challenge a practice they feel does not conform with these values.
