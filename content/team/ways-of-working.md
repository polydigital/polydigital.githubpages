We are using [Trello here](https://trello.com/b/o8tbThEE/hitch-my-ride) in whatever way comes to us:

* We set goals which are time bound and work towards a mission (of some sort, eg. Hitch my Ride Discovery).
* We use it to plan work together, assign and schedule it and then to review what we’ve done.
* We make lists of things we might want to think about or need to address outside of actual tasks we are working on.

We meet every 1 to  2 weeks to review the work we’ve done and plan for the next 2 week sprint.

We are using [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1HUt2s7WC4JF6WogM-DhZBT9X4k3g5g3z) for our docs.

We are getting a blog/website soon which we will post anything we want to communicate with others on such as [our Values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mHOufy6pDNMs9RGbb9lE9cUyYuclwEw_fhTOnvyhiM/edit).

We review how we have worked in previous sprint and record changes to make for next.

We ping each other when we want feedback on something (or have done something) and we use what’s app, hangouts for video and not too much email.
